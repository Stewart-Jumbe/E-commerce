# Ecommerce App –DfE Final Project 
<br /> 
<br /> 

###Scope <br /> 

  
The project requirements were to:  

  
-Use Feature-Branch Model: main/dev/feature for version control. <br /> 
-Create a project management board with full expansion on user stories, acceptance criteria and tasks needed to complete the project.<br />  
-Produce a risk assessment which outlines the issues and risks faced during the project timeframe. <br /> 
-Create a relational database, locally or within the Cloud, which is used to persist data for the project. <br />   
-Produce a functional application ‘back-end’, written in Java with a suitable framework (Spring Boot), which meets the requirements set on your Scrum Kanban board.<br />  
-Build a .Jar  application, including any dependencies it might need, produced using an integrated build tool (Maven). <br />  
-Make a series of API calls designed with postman, used for CRUD functionality. (Create, Read, Update, Delete). <br />  
-Fully designed test suites for the application you are creating, including both unit and integration tests. <br /> 
<br /> 
<br /> 
## Why am I doing this? <br /> 
<br /> 
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the Java software development skills I have acquired during the QA Academy Software Development Bootcamp.<br />  
Building an executable application also illustrates my understanding of SOLID principles and familiarity with the tools and framework commonly used in software development industry<br /> 
<br /> 
## How I expected the challenge to go<br /> 
<br /> 
I was excited by the opportunity to individually create my own app, but was also aware that there were areas that I did not have much practical experience in, 
such as Jira, and managing git branches on a live project. I felt that I had sufficient time to create the minimum viable product, and had adequate knowledge and resources to create the application.<br />     
<br /> 
## What went well<br /> 
<br /> 
I found the process of developing the app challenging and enjoyable. Although the projects were an individual task rather than a group task, it was great to still have an opportunity to collaborate and help my colleagues,<br /> 
on the parts of the projects that were similar. Overall, developing the E-commerce app, provided wonderful experiences and further develop my understanding of fundamental Java principles such as unit and integration testing. <br /> 
<br /> 
## What didn't go as planned<br /> 
<br /> 
I found that the errors generated in testing the app were not very specific, which meant that it took longer to resolve issues. 
I think that as I spend more time programming using Java, I will develop a better understanding of what the error messages are pointing to. 
I also could not get the Update (a method called updateCustomerInfo ) functionality to pass the unit testing with Mockito, although the method worked in practice.  
<br /> 
## Possible Improvements<br /> 
<br /> 
I would like to add the following functionality in the future: 
-Add a front-end to provide a better user experience, as they can use a browser rather than Postman.<br /> 
-Add more logic and custom exceptions to the setters, to ensure users provide the correct data, and to provide more specific messaged for incorrectly entered data.<br /> 
-An Inventory Class which would allow users to add items they would like to sell.<br />
